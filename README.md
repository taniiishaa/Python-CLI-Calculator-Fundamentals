TASK SUMMARY : 

This repository contains a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator built using Python. This project was a foundational task that guided me through a full development workflow, from writing code to managing it with Git and GitHub.

My Development Process:-
1. Project Planning & Scaffolding: I began by defining the core objective and breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. I used functions to encapsulate each operation, promoting a clean, modular, and reusable codebase.

2. Core Implementation: I developed the main application logic using a while loop to create a persistent, interactive session. I implemented conditional statements (if/elif/else) to direct the program's flow based on user choices.

3. Error Handling: To ensure the calculator is reliable, I integrated try-except blocks to catch ValueError for non-numeric input and added a specific check to prevent a ZeroDivisionError. This makes the application more stable and user-friendly.

4. Collaboration & Deployment with GitHub: Finally, I pushed my local repository to GitHub, creating a public-facing project. This step was crucial for showcasing the final product and its code. I also updated this README.md file to provide a clear, detailed overview of the project and my development process, demonstrating my ability to document my work effectively.

CALCULATOR DESCRIPTION : 

This is a robust and user-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator built with Python. Developed as a foundational project, this application demonstrates key programming concepts including modular function design, conditional logic, and effective user input handling.

The application operates in a continuous loop, providing a seamless and interactive experience for the user. It accurately performs essential arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—while incorporating best practices such as exception handling to manage invalid inputs and a specific safeguard against division by zero errors.

Key Features :-
1. Clean and Modular Code: Each arithmetic function is defined separately, promoting readability and reusability.

2. Intuitive CLI: The interface is simple to navigate, guiding the user with clear prompts for operation selection and numerical input.

3. Robust Error Handling: The program gracefully handles non-numeric input and prevents crashes from common errors like division by zero.

4. Persistent Session: The application runs in a while loop, allowing for multiple calculations without needing to be restarted.

5. User-Controlled Exit: Users can easily terminate the program at any time by typing exit.

This project serves as a solid example of building a practical and reliable application from the ground up, showcasing proficiency in fundamental Python programming principles.

DESCRIPTION : 

This is a robust and user-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator built with Python. Developed as a foundational project, this application demonstrates key programming concepts including modular function design, conditional logic, and effective user input handling.

The application operates in a continuous loop, providing a seamless and interactive experience for the user. It accurately performs essential arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—while incorporating best practices such as exception handling to manage invalid inputs and a specific safeguard against division by zero errors.

Key Features :-
1. Clean and Modular Code: Each arithmetic function is defined separately, promoting readability and reusability.

2. Intuitive CLI: The interface is simple to navigate, guiding the user with clear prompts for operation selection and numerical input.

3. Robust Error Handling: The program gracefully handles non-numeric input and prevents crashes from common errors like division by zero.

4. Persistent Session: The application runs in a while loop, allowing for multiple calculations without needing to be restarted.

5. User-Controlled Exit: Users can easily terminate the program at any time by typing exit.

This project serves as a solid example of building a practical and reliable application from the ground up, showcasing proficiency in fundamental Python programming principles.
